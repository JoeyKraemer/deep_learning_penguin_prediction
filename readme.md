## Penguin Predictive AI

This project explores predictive modeling using the Palmer Penguins dataset. The main analysis and modeling are performed in the Jupyter Notebook `AML_penguins.ipynb`.

### Dataset
The dataset used is `palmerpenguins.csv`, which contains measurements for penguin species observed in Antarctica.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install JupyterLab

If you don't have JupyterLab installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

Or, if you prefer using conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

### 2. Launch JupyterLab

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

```bash
cd DIRECTORY/penguin_predictive_ai
```

Start JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `AML_penguins.ipynb` in JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.
3. Make sure `palmerpenguins.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
